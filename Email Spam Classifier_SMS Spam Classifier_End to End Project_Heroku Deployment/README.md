# Email Spam Classifier
## Overview
This Email Spam Classifier is a machine learning project that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify emails as either spam or not spam (ham). The model is deployed on Heroku, making it accessible to users for real-time email spam detection.

## Features
1. Email Spam Detection: The classifier uses a trained machine learning model to analyze the content of emails and determine whether they are spam or not.

2. NLP Techniques: Natural Language Processing techniques are employed to process and analyze the text content of emails, extracting meaningful features for classification.

3. User-Friendly Interface: The deployed application provides a user-friendly interface where users can input an email message and receive an instant classification result.

4. Real-Time Scoring: Emails are scored in real-time, ensuring that users receive immediate feedback on the spam status of their messages.

## How it Works
1. Input Email: Users provide an email message that they want to classify as spam or not spam.

2. Text Processing: The input email text is preprocessed using NLP techniques, which includes tokenization, removing stop words, and vectorization.

3. Classification: The preprocessed email is passed through a trained machine learning model that has learned to classify emails as spam or not spam based on a labeled dataset.

4. Result: The model generates a classification result, and the user is presented with the outcome, indicating whether the email is classified as spam or not.

## Technologies Used
1. Python: The core programming language for building the machine learning model and web application.

2. Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn and other machine learning libraries are used for training and deploying the classification model.

3. Natural Language Processing (NLP): NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and SpaCy are employed for text preprocessing and feature extraction.

4. Heroku: The application is deployed on the Heroku platform, making it accessible over the internet.

5. Streamlit: The web application is built using streamlit, a micro web framework for Python.

## Usage
To use the Email Spam Classifier, follow these steps:

Visit the deployed Heroku application URL.

Enter the email text that you want to classify.

Click the "Classify" button.

The result will be displayed on the screen, indicating whether the email is spam or not spam.

## Deployment
The Email Spam Classifier is deployed on Heroku and can be accessed at Heroku App URL.
